# LMeter

LMeter is a Dalamud plugin for displaying your ACT combat log data. The purpose of this plugin is to provide a highly customizable dps/hps meter without having to rely on clunky web-based overlays.

The version of this plugin in this repository is specifically feature frozen version of the last LMeter build from Endwalker 6.5 that was version 0.3.1.0 originally. I decided to fork it myself when Dawntrail came out and update it, since the newer official versions caused my game to crash as it had conflicts with other programs and I do not need any features introduced in them. I will not be porting most if any features and changes from the official version back into this one and this one will stay as a maintained and updated separate version stuck in the 0.3.1.0 build of the plugin.

## How to Install

LMeter is not available in the standard Dalamud plugin repository and must be installed as a third party repository.
